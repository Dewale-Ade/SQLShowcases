--------Project Overview

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing global COVID-19 data using PostgreSQL.
The objective is to uncover trends related to cases, deaths, infection rates, and vaccinations by leveraging advanced SQL techniques.

The project demonstrates strong SQL fundamentals as well as analytical thinking through real-world public health data.

--------Dataset Description

The analysis is based on two datasets:

1️ COVID Deaths Dataset

Contains daily records of:

Location (Country / Region)

Date

Total Cases

New Cases

Total Deaths

New Deaths

Population

Continent 

️2 COVID Vaccinations Dataset

Contains daily vaccination data including:

Location

Date

New Vaccinations

--------Project Objectives

Analyze COVID-19 case and death trends globally and by country

Calculate infection and death percentages

Compare infection rates relative to population

Analyze vaccination progress over time

Practice advanced SQL querying and data transformation techniques

-------- Skills & Concepts Used

Joins

Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Window Functions

Aggregate Functions

Temporary Tables

Views

Data Type Conversions

Time-series analysis

Key Analysis Performed

Case & Death Analysis

Total cases vs total deaths

Death percentage by country

Global death rate over time

Population-Based Insights

Percentage of population infected

Countries with highest infection rates

Countries and continents with highest death counts

Vaccination Analysis

Rolling total of people vaccinated per country

Percentage of population vaccinated over time

Comparison of vaccination progress across regions

Feature Engineering & Transformations

Converted numeric fields to appropriate data types

Calculated rolling vaccination totals using window functions

Created reusable views for visualization and reporting

Used temporary tables for intermediate analysis



--------Sample Insights 

Countries with larger populations do not always have higher infection rates

Death percentages vary significantly across regions

Vaccination rollouts progressed at different speeds globally

Window functions are essential for time-based vaccination analysis

 --------Tools & Technologies

Database: PostgreSQL

Language: SQL

Data Source: Public COVID-19 datasets

Future Enhancements

Build dashboards using Tableau or Power BI

Perform trend forecasting

Add country-level comparisons over time

Optimize queries using indexing
